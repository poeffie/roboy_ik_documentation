# CASPR Initialisation

CASPR can simply be downloaded [here](https://github.com/darwinlau/CASPR) and unzipped. As CASPR runs with Matlab only, you also need to have a working version of MatLab.
To run CASPR open your MatLab and simply navigate within your *"Current Folder"* menu into your CASPR folder to execute the `initialize_CASPR.m` file. Is this done sucessfully, navigate (within MatLab) into the GUI folder and execute `CASPR_GUI.m`. This should usually work without any errors. 

If there occur any errors, it could possibly be due to some dependecies errors. CASPR depends on the following libraries:

* 'qhull' - a convex hull library that is used throughout the Workspace analysis module. 
* 'optitoolbox' - a MATLAB optimisation toolbox. The toolbox is used within the Inverse Dynamics and Design Optimisation modules.

If any other errors occur, consider reading the full [CASPR documentation in the "docs" folder](https://github.com/darwinlau/CASPR/tree/master/docs) or contacting Darvin Lau.

#CASPROS Installation
For the [installation](https://devanthro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CO/pages/75666195/Install+CASPROS) and [usage of CASPROS](https://devanthro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CO/pages/76156641/Using+CASPROS) I would like to reference to the tutorials, made by a team colleague, Hollie Barnett.
